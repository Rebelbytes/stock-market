# 📈 Real-Time Stock Market Data Pipeline with Kafka and AWS


# 🚀 Introduction

   In this project, you’ll build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for real-time stock market data processing using Apache Kafka and Amazon Web Services (AWS). The project focuses on streaming, storing, and analyzing stock market data efficiently.


# 🏗️ Architecture

  This project integrates multiple technologies, creating a modular and scalable pipeline for real-time data ingestion, processing, and querying.

      Data Streaming: 🌀 Apache Kafka

      
# 📂 Dataset

   We use any stock market dataset to simulate and analyze real-time data pipelines.
   
   Example dataset: 📄 Processed Stock Market Data


# ✨ Key Features

   ✅ Real-Time Data Streaming: Stream stock market data with Kafka.

   ✅ Cloud Storage: Store ingested data in AWS S3 for scalability.
   
   ✅ Data Transformation: Process raw data into structured formats with Glue.
   
   ✅ Querying & Analysis: Run SQL queries on Athena for insights.
   
   ✅ Automation: Automate workflows with Python scripts and AWS triggers.


# 📋 Prerequisites

🆓 An AWS account with permissions for S3, Glue, and Athena.

🌀 A Kafka setup (local or cloud-based).

🐍 Python installed with libraries like boto3 and kafka-python.

📄 Dataset file or Kafka topic for real-time data ingestion.


# 🛠️ Steps to Execute the Project

  Set Up Kafka 🌀

  1.Create Kafka topics for stock market data.
  
   Write a Kafka producer to stream or simulate real-time stock data.
   
   Data Ingestion 📥

  2.Stream data from Kafka topics to AWS S3 using Python scripts.
  
   Data Catalog & Crawler 🔍

  3.Use AWS Glue to create crawlers and catalogs for data stored in S3.
  
   Data Transformation 🛠️

  4.Use Glue ETL jobs to process raw data into structured formats.
   
   Data Querying 📊

  5.Analyze data using AWS Athena and SQL queries.
  
   Automation ⚙️

  6.Deploy EC2 instances to run Kafka brokers and data pipeline scripts.
  
   Automate workflows with Python scripts and AWS Glue triggers.

   
# 🎯 Project Output

   📂 Stored Data: Real-time stock market data saved in S3.
   
   📊 Transformed Data: Query-ready structured data in Athena.
   
   ⚡ Scalable Pipeline: Fault-tolerant and real-time ready pipeline.
